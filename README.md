# Passwordpump_RP2040

This project is base on the very cool and amazing project PasswordPump V2 by Dan Murphy. It was modified to make it work with rapsberry pico (RP2040). Some compromises where made, the keyboard-source for languages selection
it at first gone, with some effort it could surely be integrated later.

I´m not a fan of documentation but added some pictures and wirig guides, there you´ll hopefully find  all you need to make yours.
The binary has been also added and you can just flash the pico with the .U2F file and be then ready to go :) Grettings!!
